## About

The first wave of COVID-19 impacted the global economy as the world was never ready for the pandemic. It resulted in a rise in cases, a rise in deaths, a rise in unemployment, and a rise in poverty, resulting in an economic slowdown. In this project, I analyze the spread of COVID-19 cases and all the impacts of COVID-19 on the economy.

The dataset we are using to analyze the impacts of covid-19 is downloaded from Kaggle. It contains data about:

(1)- the country code  
(2)- name of all the countries  
(3)- date of the record  
(4)- Human development index of all the countries  
(5)- Daily covid-19 cases  
(6)- Daily deaths due to covid-19  
(7)- stringency index of the countries  
(8)- the population of the countries  
(9)- GDP per capita of the countries
